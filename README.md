Explorations in Error Tracking

###Rollbar vs New Relic

Analyze Rollbar and New Relic error tracing and reporting:
- performance on page load
- file size
- admin options
- admin usability
- pricing
- deployment tracking
- source maps
- admin console query options
- uncaughtException handling (graceful exit)


#### Considerations
Log uncaughtException, but then exit

When an exception is not handled anywhere else, it will be emitted on the processâ€˜s 'uncaughtException' event. We can listen for this event to do some logging, but we should allow the process to shut down gracefully.
